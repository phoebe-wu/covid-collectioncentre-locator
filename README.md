# COVID-19 BC Collection Center Locator

## 
A simple search application that allows people who have been exposed to Covid-19 to locate a Covid-19 Collection Center
in BC in order to get tested. The application will allow users to search for a collection center in their city and will
provide the following information:
- Name
- Address
- Phone Number
- City
- Whether an appointment is required
- Whether the center is open on weekends
- Whether the center is drive-through
- Whether the center tests children

I am interested in this project because I think an application like this is mandatory in a time like this.
