# COVID-19 BC Collection Centre Locator
A simple search application that allows people who have been exposed to Covid-19 to locate a Covid-19 Collection Centre
in BC in order to get tested. The application will allow users to search for a collection center in their city and will
provide the following information:
- Name
- Address
- City
- Phone number (if available)

Users will be able to search for collection centres in their city or health authority and may also choose to filter 
their results by the following criteria:
- Whether the centre requires an appointment
- Whether the centre is open on at least one day of the weekend
- Whether the centre offers drive-through testing
- Whether the centre tests all children between the ages of 0-16
- Whether the centre requires a referral

Users will also be able to save their filter results to a favourite list for later reference.

I am interested in this project because I think an application like this is relevant to current events and is mandatory
 during a time like this.
