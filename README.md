# COVID-19 BC Collection Center Locator


A simple search application that allows people who have been exposed to Covid-19 to locate a Covid-19 Collection Center
in BC in order to get tested. The application will allow users to search for a collection center in their city and will
provide the following information:
- Name
- Address
- Phone number
- City
- Health Authority
- Whether an appointment is required
- Whether the center is open on weekends
- Whether the center is drive-through
- Whether the center tests children
- Whether the center needs referral

I am interested in this project because I think an application like this is mandatory at a time like this.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to view all centers in a city that do drive-through testing.
- As a user, I want to be able to view all centers in a health authority.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a center and add it to a "favourites" list.
